# METRO HELP PROJECT

This is a project designed to help the people travelling in the bengaluru metro to navigate through the metro. It happens often times that the trains are very crowded 
and thus we are unable to look at the upcoming stations and number of station till our stop. 
This information is often times inaccessible on the phone while in the train as the internet connection may be bad due to the train being in a tunnel.
In that case having an app like this can help out the commuters a lot. It can also help inexperienced travellers by giving them information about the metro routes.

It takes the source and destination stations as input and gives some vital information about the travel.
- It tells which trains have to be boarded and which direction the trains should be going. 
- It gives the number of stations in between the source and the destination and gives an approximate Travel time.
- It tells whether you have to change the metro lines at some point or not and if so at which point.

The Code is written completely in python. It uses the graph data structure to store the stations and then traverses this graph to find the shortest path.

The project is in a very preliminary stage and can be further expanded to multiple metro cities and converted into an offline app to be more helpful.
